# Advent of Code 2020

Solutions repo for advent of code 2020.
This year I'm going to use rust as progamming language.

## Structure

Each day will have it's own folder with the code, input and other assets.

### DayXX

- Cargo.lock
- Cargo.toml
- README.md
- src/
  - main.rs
- assets/
  - example_input.txt
  - problem_input.txt

`cargo run` should be enough to run the solution.

### Rust version

`rustc 1.47.0 (18bf6b4f0 2020-10-07)`
